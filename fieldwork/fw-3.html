          <h2 class="h2">Summary</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            I met with Andy Ho - a Singaporean producer who runs a production agency in Vietnam, whom I previously encountered through an online Mekong-region screenwriting programme. Our discussion centred on cultural differences between Singapore and Vietnam, eventually shifting toward writing, storytelling, and the broader creative ecosystem in the Mekong region. He described a persistent shortage of high-quality screenwriting and the limited investment in the region’s film industries, creating a cycle in which strong stories are needed to attract funding, yet screenwriters lack adequate support to develop them.

          <h2 class="h2">Observations</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The producer highlighted that although the Mekong region (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) has rich cultural narratives, there is insufficient infrastructural and financial investment to develop them into high-production films
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing is widely undervalued: aspiring screenwriters receive little recognition, mentorship, or financial incentive, resulting in a small talent pool.
            </li>
            <li>
              This lack of strong scripts discourages external investment, as producers rely heavily on well-developed stories to secure funding and justify production costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              He emphasised that advocating for better writing practices and elevating local storytelling capabilities could shift industry perceptions and demonstrate the region’s creative potential.

          <h2 class="h2">Challenges & Reflections</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            A structural “loop” exists: limited investment leads to fewer skilled writers, which in turn reduces the availability of compelling stories that could attract funding.
Industry gatekeeping and market preferences often overshadow regional narratives, making it harder for Mekong stories to reach international platforms.
The undervaluation of writing discourages young creatives from pursuing storytelling-related careers, weakening the narrative pipeline.

          <h2 class="h2">Next Steps</h2>
          <ul>
              This conversation offered valuable insight into how regional storytelling ecosystems function and why strong narrative foundations are essential for cultural expression and media production. His perspective reinforced the importance of investing in story creation, not only story consumption. It also connects closely to my research interest: if storytelling is a cultural practice that requires ongoing support and participation, then designing tools and experiences that encourage narrative creation—at grassroots levels—can contribute to a healthier storytelling culture. His emphasis on strengthening writing in the Mekong region parallels my project’s aim of enabling people to generate, share, and preserve stories in accessible ways. It underscores that without mechanisms that support the creation and performance of stories, cultural traditions risk stagnation or disappearance.
