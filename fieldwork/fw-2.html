          <h2 class="h2">Summary</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            Players consistently gravitated toward games with short rounds, small component demands, and easy-to-grasp mechanics. Across the session, participants rotated between different game types: single-player, team-based, strategic, and luck-driven, to explore varied dynamics.
Conversation emerged naturally throughout play, with participants discussing strategies, exchanging reflections, and forming new temporary teams. Overall, players appeared motivated not only by winning but by experimenting with possibilities and understanding different approaches within each game.

          <ul>
                        <li>
              Players selected games that were quick to set up and learn, prioritising formats that enabled fast rounds and flexible participation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The games offered distinct social atmospheres: some required silence and concentration (e.g., bluffing games), while others encouraged open communication and teamwork, even among strangers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn-based structures facilitated natural conversation during downtime, whereas high-focus games limited dialogue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants frequently verbalised their strategies both during and after gameplay, contributing to ongoing discussions and shared analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              When learning a new game together, players organically assumed complementary roles (e.g., explorers vs. observers), testing different actions and collectively evaluating successful or interesting strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Respectful turn-taking and active listening were consistently maintained, with players pausing their moves to allow others to finish speaking.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h2">Challenges & Reflections</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            Games requiring sustained concentration left little room for social interaction, making it harder to maintain the conversational flow present in more flexible or turn-based games.
Switching between game types sometimes disrupted group rhythm, especially when transitioning from a highly social game to a more cognitively demanding one.
Balancing strategic decision-making with casual conversation posed intermittent difficulty, particularly when players became deeply invested in optimising their moves.
This session highlighted how different game structures shape social dynamics, communication patterns, and collaborative behaviour. Players were less driven by competition than by a desire to explore possibilities, share insights, and test new strategies together. The ease with which conversation emerged, both related and unrelated to the game, suggests that well-designed play environments naturally support relationship-building and fluid interaction. Observing players shift teams, exchange roles, and openly explain their thinking reinforced the potential of games as a medium for collective engagement, improvisation, and shared meaning-making.
