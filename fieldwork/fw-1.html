          <h2 class="h2">Context & Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Knowing that I want to design an interaction that helps translate expansive cultural content into a digestible and engaging experience, I wanted to explore if the exhibitions at Singapore Botanic Gardens have implemented any interactive design and explore how effective they are at supporting the exhibition content.

          <h2 class="h2">What Happened</h2>

          
          <p>
            When we toured the Centre for Ethnobotany, I found a very beautiful interaction display called 'Burkill's Dictionary', which is a a digitized version of Burkill's Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula in a space designed to resemble his study, allowing visitors to explore excerpts from the 1935 document on useful tropical plants and their indigenous knowledge. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With the heavy text content, the interaction was designed to resemble the physical book, and visitors can 'flip' the page to see the content using the touch-screen, which is quite immersive. The entire interaction is designed very beautifully and looks like a dated manuscript, which is fitting with the theme and the spatial design of the building.
            However, aside from the flipping pages, I felt that the display doesn't employ any further interaction design and was still heavily reliant on long text content with occasional images.

          <h2 class="h2">Key Observations / Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There's a lot of potential for interactive design in exhibition designs, since they can make longform, text-heavy or factual content more engaging and accessible to all ages.</li>
            <li>However, we shouldn't rely too much on text-only, since this display was in a dimly-lit area, reading for too long is tiring for the eyes and becomes repretitive and boring.</li>
            <li>Having a touch-screen installation presents other opportunities for interaction design. There were gamification mechanics we could employ to visualize the text content instead, such as videos/animation other than just include static images. Or have a quiz or puzzle type game mechanic could have also been useful to help with knowledge retention.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="card">
          <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This session presents a potential for effective interaction design, especially when we have the technology to have on-site interactive installation display such as these, the focus can be on design engaging interaction design that not only look aesthetically pleasing, which in this case follows the theme of the exhibition and spatial design where it's placed, but also presents the content in an accessible and engaging way.

        <section>
          <h2 class="h2">Next Actions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider how might we convert long, factual, text-heavy content (such as narratives and stories) into digestible formats.</li>
            <li>Would it be possible to interact on-site other than just online? How can it be effective both ways?</li>
            <li>What other interactions can we employ on-site to make the display more effective and accesible? What about visitors with disabilities, can interactive designs cater to their conditions?</li>
          </ul>
