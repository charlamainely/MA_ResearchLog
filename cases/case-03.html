                    <p class="measure">
            Made by an organization that promotes cultural heritage from Quang Tri (a province of Vietnam). I was lured in as the domain sounded very official but it's actually not made by an official agency.

          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              Website only provides basic classification based on official regulations (which doesn’t classify specifically categories in each class of cultural heritage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Though there are shown examples of each category, it’s not detailed and are too generalized, and are only focused on the most famous artifacts. Even a whole category of cultural heritage is summarize as only a list of the most notable with some explanation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Website does have an interesting geographical display of heritage sites and artifacts, and when clicked a little more information is displayed for each item. But this fails to showcase intangible heritage as it’s mainly focused on geographical sites (not even artifacts).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            Overall, website seems to be more for tourism purposes than actual archival information, though the branding of the site makes it misleading the real purpose of the site. The domain name is also misleading as it claims to be more legitimate than it really is. The information provided is too simple and copied from official government announcements and based only on official governmental/international recognition.
