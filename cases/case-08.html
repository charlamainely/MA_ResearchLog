                    <p class="measure">
            Though it was also conceived during a period where social games were super popular, Movie Star Planet (MSP) stood out not only for its premise (players are Hollywood stars in LA), but also for the expansive studio feature that allowed players to create their own shorts with the given assets.
The internet exploded with these micro-narratives produced by the studio feature, making the aesthetics well-known across the space. Players were exercising their vernacular creativity to the fullest, and pushing the boundaries of storytelling online.

                    <p class="measure">
            The studio feature was ahead of its time, allowing players to create and share content. This both benefitted the players as some went on to create very popular narratives and became content creators using this platform, and also the company as it popularize the style and branding across the digital space.

          <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            As much as I would love to create a sandbox experience like the studio feature of MPS, the market has already seen more of these studio feature, and yet none has been as successful as MPS. Perhaps it was due to the time period and interests of internet-users then that popularize this format. But more research needs to be done into understanding why this feature was so uniquely beloved by users.
