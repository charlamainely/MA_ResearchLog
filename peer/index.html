          <h2 class="h3">Context</h2>
          <p>I met Yi Kai - A Design for Social Future Student - and I introduced my project topic to him, and asked for his insight as a perfomance artist and DSF student.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Discussion & Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Yi Kai is also doing a project relating to storytelling, but in a performance-based, where particpants are invited to pair up and share their stories, listen to the other person's stories, and retell them.</li>
            <li>I asked him about the reception from the participants and if it was challenging to find people to participate, and it seemed to not be at all, as people were very willing to share stories, and even more so to listen to others' stories.</li>
            <li>Most participants enjoyed listening to others since it gave them an insightful and surprising view into other people's lives, especially if the listeners are the ones always expected to tell, rather than listen.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Reflection</h3>
          <p>Storytelling can be practiced in different way, and he gave me his perspective in facilitating and observing it being practiced in person. Participants seem to enjoy taking part, and he has conducted this with many different groups of storytellers (young, old, disabled, queer,...)</p>
          <p>The face-to-face component creates a more intimate environment for people to be vulnerable and share their experience, and to have someone retell their stories is a way for them to be recognized.</p>


          <h3 class="h3">Next Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>How can I bring this intimate experience into the digital space? In the digital space, we can faciliate virtual environment to help bring people together easier, but hard to recreate intimacy that gets people to open up. So there has to be incentives to get people to participate, and measures to keep stories respectful.</li>
            <li>I will approach him for further in-depth interviews about the workshop and insights gained to see how I might include them into a digital based platform.</li>
          </ol>
