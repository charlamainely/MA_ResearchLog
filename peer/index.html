          <h2 class="h3">Context</h2>
          <p>I met Yi Kai - A Design for Social Future student - who I introduced my project topic to. And I asked for his insight as a perfomance artist and DSF student who is also working with facilitating storytelling in performance.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Discussion & Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Yi Kai is also doing a project relating to storytelling, but in a performance-based, where particpants are invited to pair up and share their stories, listen to the other person's stories, and retell them.</li>
            <li>I asked him about the reception from the participants and if it was challenging to find people to participate, and it seemed to not be at all, as people were very willing to share stories, and even more so to listen to others' stories.</li>
            <li>Most participants enjoyed listening to others since it gave them an insightful and surprising view into other people's lives, especially if the listeners are the ones always expected to tell, rather than listen.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Reflection</h3>
          <p>Storytelling can be practiced in different way, and he gave me his perspective in facilitating and observing it being practiced in person. Participants seem to enjoy taking part, and he has conducted this with many different groups of storytellers (young, old, disabled, queer,...)</p>
          <p>The face-to-face component creates a more intimate environment for people to be vulnerable and share their experience, and to have someone retell their stories is a way for them to be recognized.</p>


          <h3 class="h3">Next Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>How can I bring this intimate experience into the digital space? In the digital space, we can faciliate virtual environment to help bring people together easier, but hard to recreate intimacy that gets people to open up. So there has to be incentives to get people to participate, and measures to keep stories respectful.</li>
            <li>I will approach him for further in-depth interviews about the workshop and insights gained to see how I might include them into a digital based platform.</li>
          </ol>

                      <p class="measure">
            After writing my design briefs, I asked for feedback from Nur as well as for her input on the current direction of my project.

            <h3 class="h3">Discussion & Insights</h3>
                      <p class="measure">
            When asked to describe my project, I explained it as a game where the player learn about storytelling (structure, themes, and practices) and are given a space to create story.
However, Nur asked if I considered how different means to storytelling might affect the outcome of the story, for example, if the story was performed live, would the storyteller do something different than if it was on a digital platform.
Additionally, I was asked how I would collect story examples, and build a database of stories to inform the ideation and prototype phase.

            <h3 class="h3">Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
                      <p class="measure">
                        <ol>
            <li>After this feedback, I looked deeper into storytelling and how different means of delivery would affect the adaptation of the stories. And while digital platform has its advantages, it might also have disadvantages that impact the storytelling process, so how might we bring in the performative element of storytelling into the digital platform?</li>
            <li>Secondly, I need to start documenting story, which I imagine will be both through literature review, reading existing archives, and also interviews with Vietnamese literature experts to both collect and validate information.</li>
