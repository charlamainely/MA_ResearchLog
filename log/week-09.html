              <h3>First Track Workshop</h3>
           
            <li>
              For our first track workshop, we met Ms. Gracia Goh who presented her postgraduate projects, with design artifacts as well. And we had an ideation workshop where we try to contextualize our research output given different situational prompt.
            </li>
            <li>
              My favourite prompt has to be what I would do if I was given infinite money to pursue this research.
            </li>
              <figure class="figure">
            </li>
              <img src="log_images/week_9/my_ideas.jpg" alt="My ideation notes"/>
           
              <figcaption class="figcap">My ideation notes</figcaption>
           
              </figure>
           
            <li>
              However, we were then asked to present our ideas to another classmate, and get their feedback. And also switch with them, and try to do the same process but for their research topic (and they do ours). And we came up with quite a few good ones for each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              My classmate, Mas, also suggested some unexpected ideas that I hadn't considered before.
            </li>
           
              <h3>Critical Discourse Seminar Presentation</h3>
          
            <li>
              For the presentation, I received quite positive feedback, with high note definitely on the visualizations I included in the presentation. However, Joselyn did mention for my essay, I should include the Vietnamese context more, as well as expand on the community-based approach in my research.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, since I sped through the presentation, some key terminologies might need explaining, which I will do so in the essay.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, the first draft of my design framework isn't satisfactory yet, hence why I will redesign it for the upcoming Design Lab 1 Seminar Presentation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="reflection">
          <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            The track workshop really gave me a new experience on how others view my research topic. I think this perception would be determined based on how well I explain it, and how clearly defined my topic is. But based on my current explanation, my classmate has been able to produce some interesting ideas that I would definitely consider for my research.
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="log_images/week_9/mas_ideas.jpg" alt="My ideation notes"/>
  <figcaption class="figcap">My ideation notes</figcaption>
</figure>
And the different situational prompts also allowed me to see my topic through different lens, and see how I would approach it if there weren't any practical constraints.
As for the presentation, I took down notes so that I can expand on them in my essay. However, the feedback about grounding the research in Vietnamese context is very important, as so far, I haven't included many Vietnamese articles or scholarly sources. So I will look into having more of these for the essay.
