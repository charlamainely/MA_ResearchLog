              <h3>Track Workshop</h3>
           
            <li>
              For the track workshop this week, we met Chua Jia Xiang who presented about his work in Service Design and the Lean Six Sigma framework. And though I don't adopt this specifically, it was still interesting to learn about service design.

              <h3>Topic Pivot</h3>
           
            <li>
              After some reflection from the previous week that extended towards this week, I realized that by narrowing the object of preservation to folktales, I have accidentally put myself into the conventional cultural preservation approach of trying to capture and contain it. And though it is important, the context to justify its preservation isn't strong enough to keep focusing on it alone. So, as Schon recommended, I tried to reframe the problem and focus more on just purely enabling storytelling, or facilitating for storytelling to organically happen. This took some effort to remap my research, but I tried different forms of reframing and visualized it so that it's clearer.

              <h3>Concept Map Prototype showcase</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
              In a more practical manner, we had a showcase of concept map in class and I presented my digital concept map prototype. While it's still using placeholder for items, the mechanic functionalities works and I was able to gather some construction feedback from my peers to keep improving it.

              <h3>Critical Discourse Essay Consultation</h3>
            
            <li>
              It was also my week for the Critical Discourse essay consultation. And because I had a topic pivot earlier in the week, I want to use the essay as a way to make sense of my new reframing.

            I was admittedly quite cautious about pivoting away from my previous trajectory, since it was already quite fleshed out. But as I was reflecting on the future of the project, I could see how the topic would become quite constrictive moving forward and would inadvertently rely on conventional approaches instead of exploring new ones. Hence, I wanted to focus more on the core of the issue, which is enabling more people to practice storytelling. And I tried to reframe it through a purely storytelling lens, or focusing more towards more performative aspect of storytelling, and trying to connect it towards the rich performative cultural heritage of Vietnam, since that was what made my context so strong.
However, as it currently stands, I still need to do more exploration to find a strong foundation for my research.
As I was trying to reframe the issue, I mapped out all the ideas to help me visualize it better.

For the concept map, though it was just a rough prototype, my classmates were already quite impressed with the functionalities of the digital version. However, Joselyn mentioned that constraining the concept map only to the computer limited the full view of all the work I did for my project. Hence, I considered creating a hybrid interactive experience of the concept map, which would be fleshed out in the following weeks.
