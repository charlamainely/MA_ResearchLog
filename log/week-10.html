              After a wonderful Deepvali, we had our Design Lab 1 Seminar Presentation. And the feedback I received was focused towards fleshing out the specific details of my research project, such as timeline, since I would have prototypes so I need to consider when and how I would test them. And since my emphasis is to reject top-down approach, I have to clearly define how I would engage and take inputs from the community for this research.

            <li>
              As for the concept map, as I have decided on the themes and how the route through the museum would be, I decided to start creating the background and prototype the digital version. I intended for this concept map to be a purely digital experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              So in creating the aesthetics for the museum, I want to do a style that was more grounded in Vietnamese context, and I was inspired by the Indochine architecture and decor.

              As I wanted to present this in class next week, I tried to make sure the prototype worked, even if it's just one scene.

            The feedback from the seminar presentation really made me reflect on the current trajectory of my research. And I wanted to do a deep reflection, based on the reflection-in-action method, to see where my research is taking me and if it's worth it to keep investigating. Despite presenting during the seminar presentation, I still had doubt about the core of my research and what was driving this change.
On the concept map side, by creating the visuals and the prototype, I discovered different ways to include gamification in my project, that I can potentially explore later in the design phases of the research.
