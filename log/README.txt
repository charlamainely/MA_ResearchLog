Research Log Starter
====================
Folders:
- /assets  -> CSS and shared assets
- /log     -> Weekly pages (duplicate week-04.html for new weeks)
- /media   -> Images and videos (use webp/png/jpg; add alt text)

How to add a new week:
1) Duplicate /log/week-04.html to /log/week-05.html
2) Update the <title>, H1, badges, and content blocks
3) Add your images to /media and update <img src="...">
4) Commit & deploy (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify)
