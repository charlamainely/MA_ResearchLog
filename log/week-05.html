              Reflected on the topic and expanded focus from preserving specific folktales to
              <strong>preserving the living practice of storytelling</strong> in Vietnamese culture.
              This reframes ICH in a more future-forward way and suggests a pathway for communities—especially
              minority groups—to preserve their own culture.

            <li>
              Sketched a <strong>lo-fi prototype idea for multilayer storytelling</strong> as an interactive design,
              inspired by fieldwork at Singapore Design Week over the weekend.

          <p>
            When I presented my ideas to Joselyn last week, she asked how I envision the final design—what kind of
            game it would be. I described the concept I had then: a branching narrative game based on Vietnamese
            folktales where players make storytelling choices that affect variations of the story (not the outcome),
            showing how communities generate their own versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After thinking it through, that idea felt restrictive: the stories themselves would mostly stay the same,
            and the nuanced variations might not be emphasized enough. That led me to <em>storytelling as a practice</em>
            that can be preserved. In this reframing, the game becomes a <strong>facilitator</strong> for communities
            to practice storytelling and share stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at oral traditions in Vietnam, a common thread is that messages are encoded in stories—transmitted
            through different media. Fieldwork at Singapore Design Week reinforced that generational wisdom and culture
            are often passed on as stories, which are easy to spread and document.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we strengthen the practice of storytelling, we can empower communities with a method to preserve
            their intangible cultural heritage and provide a platform to share stories more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge is scope: “storytelling” is broad. To make it digestible, I’ll investigate a
            <strong>specific genre of Vietnamese stories</strong> and extract both the storytelling structure and the
            encoded themes. Using that structure and theme set, I can create a <strong>prototype sandbox game</strong>
            where participants learn about structure and craft their own stories with relevant themes.

              For this week’s homework (concept map), I used the exercise to expand on the new direction.
              The role of design is clearer: <em>as a tool for making stories</em> and
              <em>as a facilitator</em> that encourages users to learn about storytelling and write their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inspired by Singapore Design Week—specifically the project <em>huemanity</em>—I’ll make a quick prototype
              of a storytelling interaction where users can <strong>deduce different stories from layered imagery</strong>.
              It’s a testbed for interactive techniques in storytelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the sandbox concept defined, I’ll begin <strong>game design</strong> (mechanics, feedback, flow)
              and <strong>narrative research</strong> (structures, motifs, themes relevant to the chosen genre).
