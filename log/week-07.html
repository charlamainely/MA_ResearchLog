              Formative Feedback Presentation
                        </h4>
            <li>
              This week we had our formative presentation, and the verbal feedback I received required me to look at the research from a more design-focus way of thinking, as in how would design tackle these issues and how would I visualize the information of the research.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also need to be more explicit about the context, which though I imply would be in Vietnam, I haven't actually emphasized it enough in the presentation. And while the project focuses on preserving folktales, I have to design a way to collect and validate these stories, and show it in my fieldwork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, I discuss about engaging with participants, but I wasn't specific on how that engagement would be exactly, hence why I have to explain further what my mode of engagement would be.
            </li>
            <li>
              My concept map is also not quite engaging yet, as it's quite plain, and I need to find a better form to present these information.

            <h3>
             Critical Discourse Consultation
            </h3>
            <li>
              For my consultation, I tried presenting all the information but it overran 7 minutes, hence I was advised to remove unnecessary slides and zoom into the important information more quickly. And I need to explain key readers and case studies to get a more overall view of the discourse. As well as offer visualizations for what I'm presenting to illustrate my point better.

            Though the formative feedback presentation as well as the critical discourse consultation weren't marked, I tried to come prepare with everything I had, which led to me not quite making it within the time limit. But the feedback really helped me realize which information was important for which presentation, and how I can trim down the information so that it's more concise and towards the point.
And because I was too content-focused, I neglected the visual aspect of the presentation, which I received from feedback on. Hence why I would also invest more time in designing the slides to keep it both informative but also visually appealing.
Dr. Aprille advice on how to approach the critical discourse using the handwriting technique as well as the funnel also really helped, and I tried using her approach and mapped out all the literature I've read using keywords to anchor me. Through that I was able to identify key areas to focus on and who were the most influential authors. It also helped me see the progression of the discourse and where the literature in different areas converges.
