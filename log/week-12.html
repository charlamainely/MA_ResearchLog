              <h3>Track Workshop</h3>
           
            <li>
              For this week's track workshop, we got to really work out our ideas using paper prototype. And I built a lo-fi board game set as a proof of concept for my idea. However, upon testing it out with a fellow classmate, Sanjana, she made me realize that the game lacks context, and requires players to be at a higher skills and already possesses knowledge of stories. This contradict with my initial assumption that we can bring out the storytelling solely based on curiosity and vernacular creativity. But now it seems that it required a more scaffolded approach.

              <h3>Storytellers of Mekong Panel Discussion</h3>
           
            <li>
              Over the weekend, I had the honour to interview some seasoned screenwriters from the Mekong region about their perspective on storytelling, about the craft itself, how it's practiced in the region, and the kind of stories that are being told there. This opportunity to interview them live on stage, as well as socialized with new and old screenwriters produced some very interesting insights for my project, and helped ground my research in the Vietnamese context.

          <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            The feedback from the track workshop really made me evaluation my conception of the participants of this workshop and how I might acclimatize them to my research prototype. I cannot make assumptions about their abilities, nor should I, and as I'm designing this prototype to be used by ordinary participants, it cannot be too challenging nor requires specialized skills. This will feed back into how I design my prototype game systems.
On the other hand, the insights from the Storytellers of Mekong really inspired my research as it helped informed the context, as well as the practice of storytelling. Based on my notes, there is an urgent need for more personal connection and socially relevance in storytelling, at least in the Mekong Region, and storytelling is being used here as mostly a form of self-expression or familial story transmission.
I believe that this framing of storytelling as a familial form of connection and social and cultural sense-making connects with a more grassroot approach to preservation, and justifies for its continued practice. I will investigate more on this.
