              As this was the project week, we had to no classes and just had to focus on our assignments and research.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of my focus was to ideate prototypes for my research, and based on the notes last week, I decided to use my concept map as a test subject. I wanted to tell a story about my research through the concept map, but also make it under the form of a game, to test the hypothesis that game can facilitate storytelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hence I started design my concept map as an exploration puzzle game where the player has to navigate around a museum - since the theme is still intangible cultural preservation. And I started sketching the concept for each room and how my concept map information would be categorize into each room.

              </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, I also started working towards my presentations, by taking the feedback from last week and trimming down all the unnecessary information.
            </li>
            
              <h3>Critical Discourse Presentation</h3>
          
            <li>
              Using the mindmap from last week, I was able to pinpoint all the key readers from my list, and through that select the most important authors that I would discuss in my presentation. And after pinpointing the key readers, I can clearly see how their ideas converge and created my presentation flow.
            </li>
           
              <figure class="figure">
           
              <img src="log_images/week_8/readers_categorized.jpg" alt="Readers categorization"/>
            
              <figcaption class="figcap">Readers categorization</figcaption>
           
            <li>
              </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
              On the point of visualization, I also tried to visualize the research problems and how the goal emerges from this problem using this diagram.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              And I also made a first attempt to visualize the design framework, but it didn't look quite nice and was still unclear. So I will attempt it again.

                    <p class="measure">
            This week I tried to focus on streamlining the presentation flow, and making sure I had only the most important information and presented them in a cohesive and straightforward way. However, I realized that by trying to visualize the information for the critical discourse presentation, it really helped me systemize the concepts of my research, and see how they overlap and what that overlap leads to.
And from the Critical Discourse presentation preparation, I could clearly see the linkage between the different areas of my research. There's a connection from how cultural heritage preservation should embrace a more participatory approach, which can be applied to preserving the oral perfomative quality of storytelling through game design.
