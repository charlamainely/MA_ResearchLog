          <p class="measure">This week I had more time to design my print prototype. The focus was definitely on coming up with the content for the booklet itself, and how can I convey the theme of familial conversation as something engaging and can be self-facilitated.</p>

<p class="measure">Recognising that I am not a clinician, and should not provide any therapy or clinical advise, I look for existing framework or treatment strategies that can be implement in my booklet. So, I adapted the information and advise from family communication therapy literature into different more accessible formats such as quizzes and star charts, in the hope that viewers will find these as practical and easy to adopt strategies that they can use in everyday setting. Additionally, there are also activities in the booklet that allow readers to gauge their own communication patterns and levels, as well as their current knowledge of family history and ideally encourage them to explore more via scaffolded games and guided facilitation tips.</p>
