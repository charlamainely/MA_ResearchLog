          <p class="measure">Having summarize the content from my residency last week, I refined the information further to establish a presentation flow. I also expressed my intention to do a full exhibition as the final output, and started asking around for potential venue, location and advise from previous exhibitions. Having thought more about my prototypes as well as the intended impact of my research, and how it might be measured, I refined the design briefs more. I established that there needs to be a way to first capture the participants closeness to their family and willingness to converse before letting them interact with the prototypes, and measure these indicators again afterwards to see if anything has changed. The research now focuses more heavily on creating the condition for change rather than directly enabling this change. For the slides as well as the presentation deck, I designed and adapted a new key visual direction based on the feedback from last semester.</p>
