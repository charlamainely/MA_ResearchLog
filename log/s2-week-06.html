          <p class="measure">For this week, I kept developing the boardgame idea into a rapid prototype. Starting from the physical board first, I designed the game journey, all the spaces and branching paths. To keep it simple, the all the branching at a certain section will consolidate back into one point, as it help keeps the game flow simple and easier to implement the node mechanic in the digital portal later on.</p>

<p class="measure">Once I was happy with the board, I implemented the digital portal as a mean to keep track of all the changing stats and deck of game contents. The goal is for the player to be as hands-free as possible, focusing on the game itself, moving their pieces and rolling, while the the portal keeps track of all their in game stats and deal out prompts. This makes it so that the game can be implemented anywhere, and at any scale, as long as they have access to the internet.</p>
