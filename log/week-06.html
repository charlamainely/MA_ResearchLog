              Attended the Masterclass by Eason Yang: to learn about social impact and how to translate research insights into relevant social innovation proposals that can have wider impact. Eason Yang is a Social Innovation Mentor (2023 – Present) at Yale University Venture design program: Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking.

              In this masterclass, I was assigned to a team with 2 students from Design for Social Future (DSF) and 1 student from Interior Design. Together, we had to come up with a social innovative design, based on the insights of DSF students after interviewing different groups of people with disabilities, and I incorporated my insights to work with games, storytelling and preserving ideas/memories.

              Our group focused on audio impaired individuals who have difficulties in everyday conversations. The most important insight we focused on was our target users reported feeling sidelined during conversations as the other person would instinctively look at the interpreter because they're the one vocalizing. So our solution is to produce an app that let deaf user customize their 'voice' via an on-screen avatar, and the visual choices would translate to the voice nuances. The app would also support 2-way conversation by converting speech from the speaking partner to text and sign language to the deaf partner on screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              We developed this idea, prototyped and pitched it within the 3-day masterclass.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also went in depth into literature review to prepare for the feedback session next week.

                    <p class="measure">
            This process gave me more insights into the idea development process and how to incorporate gamification into social innovative solutions, as well as aspects to consider to make a solution viable and widely adopted. It also gave me a new perspective in working with a certain community and consider things from their POV to design for them, not just using my own understanding and assumptions.
By developing the prototype, I was able to see how to apply my knowledge of game design into a digital product. And working closely with a specific group of target audience that face a major struggle in communication (audio-impairment), I  had to think beyond common conventions that we take for granted and really focus on product details that would work for this target audience. This also made me thinking about how to make my project more centered to my intended target audience.
