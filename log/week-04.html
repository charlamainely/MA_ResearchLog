        <h2 class="h2">Reflection</h2>
        <p>After reviewing in-class activities and feedback from last week, it was clear that using browser-based games to engage with the community for the purpose of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) preservation is a potential direction, but the scope is too big and I should start from a specific example to see if it's feasible and from there create a framework to apply for other ICH in similar categories. However, during my research, aside from the legal definition of what is ICH according to the latest Vietnamese legislation regarding cultural preservation, there are no actual recorded databases of what is recognized (or could be recognized) as ICH.</p>
        <p>While I was still trying to pick a possible example for my project, I had a talk with an screenwirter/producer acquaintance, and during our discussion, the topic of preserving the art of storytelling came up. This made me think about not only the literary heritage but also the oral traditions of Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Though we have famous oral traditions that has been recognized by UNESCO, 'narratives' are less so known and preserved as living tradition, specifically folktales. Folktales are well documented in textbooks, however, due to the way they're inscribed and taught, they become less of a living traditions, where people tell stories to each other, and create their own variantions, and more of a static and simplified reading, losing the important lessons imbued within them.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Micro-Meso-Macro Analysis:</strong> I re-analyzed the topic with a focus on preserving folktales as living traditions. At a micro level, interactive fiction offer an accessible and engaging potential to change the youth perception of folktales from static content to dynamic evolving stories. At a Meso level, we can support existing efforts of preserving ICH with a ground-up, community-driven approach that directly engage with digital natives. And at a Macro level, gamifying folktales can facilitate the practice of storytelling and turn folktales from passive reading to active participation in the digital space. <a href="../exercises/LyDuKhanhHan_MicroMesoMacroAnalysis_V02.pdf"><strong>Read my in-depth MMM anlysis here.</strong></a></li>
          <li><strong>Revised Practice Framework:</strong></li>
          <ul>
          <li> Empathy/Define: Through semi-structured interviews with Vietnamese Gen Z and literature experts, this stage explores their perceptions of folktales and storytelling, as well as how they interact with cultural heritage in the digital space. It also reviews case studies of interactive folktale adaptations to ground the research context.</li>
          <li>Ideate: Insights from interviews and case studies inform the generation of game concepts that reinterpret folktales in ways that resonate with youth and encourage collaborative engagement.</li>
          <li>Prototype: Selected folktale concepts are developed into iterative prototypes using HTML5-based technologies. The process moves from low-fi prototype to digital interactive prototypes, each experimenting with how storytelling can be transformed into engaging gameplay.</li>
          <li>Test: Prototypes are evaluated through playtesting sessions with Gen Z participants, using think-aloud method, observation in-play, and post-play interviews/surveys.</li></ul>
