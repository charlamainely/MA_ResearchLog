          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The study presents an interesting case study of a mobile application using AR and VR for cultural heritage promotion called InHeritage. This project mirrors my research direction greatly, though my research is not focused on AR and VR, I am interested in how they adopted gamification to their game design process and their research in identifying interest in this application as we both share the same target audience. Additionally, my game would also be for the purpose of cultural heritage promotion, so I want to see their suggestions after reflecting on the design process.
            </li>
            <li>
              The author presents clear argument for adopting games for cultural heritage education, showing examples of similar educational applications and what is missing in terms of gamification, but also acknowledging the pros and cons of this medium (p.10)
            </li>
            <li>
              Through their interviews, the author found great interest from the general public for educational games that adopt emerging technologies (p.14). However, the interviews also reveal pain points that was included in the game design process, such as demands for high interactivity, educational content and simple user interface (p.14). Noting these points, the author outlined key features that were included in their mobile applications to enhance gamification (p.15).
            </li>
            <li>
              Most interestingly, via surveys, the authors identified the groups most interested in this application, as well as their willingness to participate in interactive workshop (p.15). This aligns well with my current target audience.

            <li>
              The author concluded that through their research, it is shown that adoption of emerging technology and gamification to educational games help increase user engagement and motivation to learn about cultural heritage (p.31). Additionally, an application that combines cultural artifacts and gamification in the digital space has high potential of increasing awareness and understanding of cultural heritage among young people (p.31).

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            Though the application identically mirror my research, it offer many insights into the process of designing an educational application to promote cultural heritage using emerging technology in the digital space.<br>
The author interviews and surveys indicate clear interest for this genre of games, as well as a general interest in discovering more about cultural heritage from the young digital-native age group. However, the digital space currently lacks games and application to serve this cultural educational purpose, which creates opportunities for my research to cover.<br>
The design process also produces suggestions and insights to help enhance my own design practice, stressing the potential of gamification in educational game design.
