          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              This case study presented a very practical example of the struggles that small to mid size heritage organizations have when considering methods of preservation. The purpose of the case study is examine affordable access and digital preservation solutions for digital collections, specifically the JeffCo - a collection of digitized oral histories created by the Jefferson County Public Library in Colorado.
            </li>
            <li>
              The study first emphasized the importance as well as urgency to finding a suitable archival method: :"The digitization of oral histories contributes to the ultimate goals of increasing access to and preserving these valuable resources. Deteriorating audiotapes and the obsolescence of playback equipment pose serious preservation risks to analog recordings of oral histories." (p.89)
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, it's also stated that the driver of change for this migration is to "provide the community with access to the invaluable oral histories that comprise the collection." (p.96) It is clear that the goal for preservation is always so that the public can have access to it, however, it is not mentioned or discussed in the study the public perception or level of traffic to the migrated digital library hence the overall effectiveness of the solution in terms of creating awareness about the collection or the public visibility/access/perception of this archival effort remains inconclusive.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the topic is about the consideration of different options and the migration process, what stands out to me is the clear problem that this organization faced: "The constraints posed by tight budgets, lack of dedicated staff and a relatively undeveloped local technical infrastructure limited the options available for both digital preservation solutions and access." (p. 92) This supports my argument that there needs to be a radical shift in the approach of oral culture preservation, as conventional method of preservation tends to face these issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              And the study also outline a desirable outcome: "A system that was both inexpensive and provided a user-friendly administrative interface was of primary importance to the Jeffco Library, so that the building and long-term maintenance of the site would be practically and sustainably manageable for the Library." (p.96)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            This work presented a clear picture of the struggles that heritage organization face when considering methods for digital preservation, which supports my argument for a radical approach of digital preservation that engages the community directly (work with the community), instead of the conventional method we see here (work for the community) that relies completely on their existing and constrained resources.<br>
            It also reveals the unfortunate possibility that archivist face when not considering a sustainable method of preservation initially, leading to more issues in the future when migrating archival data, making the case for a sustainable method of preservation that allows easy access as well as migration of information if need be.<br>
            And I would have like to known the previous level of access to the material compared to after the digital migration, to see if there was any significant changes in their perception.<br>
            However, the study does provide a clear statement on the requirements for an ideal solution, which I would have to consider for my product if I hope for it to be adopted into mainstream usage.<br>
