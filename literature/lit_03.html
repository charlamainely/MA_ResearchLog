          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The paper is very rich, discussing about the conditions to bring about change and different types of change possible and what drives them. There is incremental and radical innovation, incremental change is small changes that improves the performance of a product or usability, while radical change is a major change. But without incremental innovation, we cannot understand the value of radical innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
              This paper presents 2 drivers of innovation: meaning change (same product different perceptions) and technology led change (tending to not be dependent on rigorous research or any research whatsoever)
            </li>
            <li>
              However it’s also outlined the conditions for changes to be considered radical and successful, and emphasized that no change is entirely brand new, as all progress has to stem from something existing in some capacity. What’s important to consider is the starting point of these changes - what kick starts the change? - and would users be willing to adopt them.

            <li>
              This tables sums up the points made quite succinctly. And the authors argue for the relationship between the dimensions of change in product meaning and practicality and the kind of innovation that it could lead to.

            <li>
              It’s interesting that the authors state that HCD tends to not lead to radical innovation as it makes us trapped in existing paradigms (via research, user testings,…) while technology led innovation is more likely to do so as they’re lead by explorations and dreams (Technology First Needs Last). And they do so mainly because they want to explore what is possible, and are less likely to be trapped by the prevalence of existing products. But too radical could lead to a product being hard to introduce or adopted. It’s not all too doomed as HCD can still lead to radical innovation, according to the authors, but this would require extensive research and observation of patterns of social and cultural changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              And finally, the paper concludes that a possible direction for development is for the design team to work on simultaneous ideas and products at the same time as this has a higher likelihood of leading to a successful idea.

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            This made me think critically about my project and the kind of innovation I want to bring about. Since incremental and radical innovation have an intrinsic relationship and both are valid and useful for different purposes, how should I classify the kind of change I want my design research to bring about?<br>
Additionally, it also highlights the human centered design process, and the importance of design research in the innovation process, but also how we can be trapped to only consider improvements to existing ideas. So, what would need to be done to break out of that cycle? The HCD is currently the framework I am considering for my practice, however, recognizing the potential limitations of this process, I have to dig deeper to recognize the patterns in the social and cultural context that could lead to more radical changes.<br>
Technology-led change is also very important to consider, which is relevant to my topic since I'm using digital storytelling as the tool for change, so how might I consider the relationship between practicality (technological aspect) and meaning to make my product actually viable and sustainable.<br>
And most importantly, how can I encourage user to adopt my product so actually make it successful?<br>
The final suggestion is also quite useful, where we are encouraged to multitask and work on multiple ideas at the same time to increase the chances of finding a successful product. I think for the early stage of my research, I have many prototype ideas that I want to work on, so I might conduct user testing on these ideas to see which has more potential.
