          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The article discusses the impact of digital storytelling in the age of technology, and the impact of hearing ordinary voices, especially those often diregarded, in public discourse.
            </li>
            <li>
              The author discusses an initiative called Digital Storytelling that encourages participants to create autobiographical films for themselves. With emerging technology in the digital space, it has given us the power to give creative agency to normal people, and provide them a platform to share their stories. This initiative is specifically designed to help amplify ordinary voices. And these films helped shared their stories of human experience, and beyond the exchange of ideas, it is helping to facilitate effective social communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digital storytelling is being used as a mean to legitimize vernacular creativity and integrate their individual human experience into the public discourse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even things that are commonly looked down in mainstream media such as tropes and cliches are being reframed as shared human experience, allowing for deeper connection and empathy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The author emphasizes that the goal for cultural studies is not to be on behalf of the community, but is "to find ways to understand and practically engage with the full diversity of existing and emerging media contexts in which they are, or are not, being heard."
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            The article reinforces my choice to use digital storytelling as a medium to help foster discourse on cultural preservation via stories of individual experiences, as it describes the potential effect it can have when these stories are integrated into public discourse.
The use of technology is innovative in this scenario as it gives everyone agency and access to participate in expressing their creativity, regardless of individual pre-requisites. 
And it's emphasis that cultural studies cannot be a top-down approach, but we must work with the community and engage with the full diversity of contexts.
