          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              This paper perfectly captures the context of my research, discussing the digitization efforts of Vietnamese cultural heritage and the impact it has on preservation of knowledge, application in education ad tourism, providing me with many solid evidentiary support for my arguments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Firstly, it emphasizes the critical nature of digitization cultural heritage and its potential in preserving knowledge (p.1584), and also recognizes the limitations of conventional preservation methods and how it lacked engagement with the youth in the digital space, while indigenous knowledge is increasingly at risk of being loss (p.1585).
            </li>
            <li>
              The concept of cultural capital is also introduced, highlight the importance of recognizing our cultural capital and preserving it (p. 1586). While listing out different examples of digitization efforts, Vietnam is mentioned as still being in the early stages, but existing efforts proves feasibility and potential. (p.1587).
            </li>
            <li>
              The concept of heritage-based education is also introduced where cultural heritage is integrated into curriculum to enhance cultural awareness and build creative capacities among students (p.1587).
            </li>
            <li>
              Digitization of cultural heritage is mutually beneficial, as it allows for communities memories to be restored, as well as for younger generation to reconnect with their ethnic cultural roots (p.1590).
            </li>
            <li>
              There are some evidences of existing application of gamification to education activities and virtual museum tours which claims to help with student engagement and information retention, but these lack supporting evidence (p.1593).
            </li>
            <li>
              However, the most important takeaway is the problems presented by the authors and their suggestions for improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aligning with my existing findings, current digitization efforts suffer from shortage of manpower with deep cultural knowledge as well as digital knowledge, and do not have funding for training of their human resources (p.1598), and more collaboration is required to create a 'community cultural information system'.
            </li>
            <li>
              The authors' suggestion is to create a system where cultural heritage data is shared, stored and managed in a unified way, but ethnic communities, cultural organization and researchers can all contribute to this ecosystem. This is exactly the solution that I want to propose. (p.1599).
            </li>

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            This is a profoundly impactful paper for my research as it underlines all my existing arguments as well as strengthen it by introducing relevant concepts that highlights the urgency of finding a sustainable digitization preservation method in Vietnam.
However, though it introduces many existing examples of digital interaction, I don't see the reported results that these initiatives claimed to have had, which makes it difficult to measure how effect these efforts were at actually disseminating cultural knowledge.
But the recommendations that the authors made align completely with my research objective and provides support for the hypothesis of my research.
