          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              This paper discusses the definition of different research methods, and specifically, research through design, which is the method that I want to apply.
            </li>
            <li>
              According to the author, research through design has to be clear about what is being achieved and communicated through the activities of art, craft or design. And these activities could involve: material research (research into the material, which in his example is physical material, but I can imagine how it applies to me), development work (showing clear evidence of the activities done and the consequent results) and action research (recording of research notes, which is what this is).
            </li>
            <li>
              The author provides this quote that he thinks applies to research through design which I find amusing: ’How can I tell what I think till I see what I make and do?’
            </li>
            <li>
              However, upon reading further, it seems that Research for Design also applies to my work, since the end goal - my artifact - is also intended to be part of my research proof. And the author defines this as "Research where the end product is an artefact - where the thinking is, so to speak, embodied in the artefact, where  the goal is not primarily communicable  knowledge in the sense of verbal  communication, but in the sense of visual or  iconic or imagistic communication." So as I progress futher into the later stages of my reseach, my approach will move from research through design to research for design.

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            The brief descriptions in this paper provides me with a good foundation to layout my research activities, and I can see how it's not always clear cut, and based on my existing framework, I will be doing a mix of research through design as well as research for design, but this helps me distinguish between different activities and how to document them accordingly.
