          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The purpose of this study was to explore how Alaska Native Community Health Workers (CHWs) perceived digital storytelling as part of a cancer education program (p.1), which is relevant to my project as I also want to investigate how impactful storytelling would be as a mean for education and cultural transmission.
            </li>
            <li>
              The research spanned over 3 years, and required 67 CHWs to create personal 2–3 min digital stories combining oral narratives with images/music. Evaluations and follow-up surveys assessed impact. (p.1)
            </li>
            <li>
              And at the end of education program, all the participants not only successfully created digital story, regardless of their respective computer skills, but also reported that digital stories enhanced their learning and was a culturally respectful way to share cancer related information. (p.1)
            </li>
            <li>
              The authors provides this definition: "Digital storytelling combines oral storytelling traditions with computer technology." (p.1) They also cite evidence that dates the inception of the concept in 1990s and states that it's a growing tool for social advocacy. (p.1)
            </li>
            <li>
              The authors also emphasizes that digital storytelling "bring the power of the media into the voice and hands of community members". (p.2)
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, it is noted that "Digital storytelling weaves past storytelling traditions with new technologies, carrying people’s stories across time past, present and future." (p.5) This is a strong statement that supports my choice to use digital storytelling as a tool for intangible cultural preservation.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Digital stories offered a forum for individual narratives to be expressed in both oral and visual dimensions, sharing the experience and culture of each participant." (p.5) This evidences the strengths of digital stories as a mean for self-expression but for the purpose of overall cultural preservation.

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <ul>
            <li>
              Overall, this study provides evidences to support my choice of using digital storytelling as a tool for community engagement and cultural preservation as it is shown to be a great bridge between traditions and technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants not only managed to achieved the outcome of the education program (create digital stories), but also expressed excitement in the creative process, and reflected on how beneficially it impacted their learning experience (p.1), as well the feeling of healing and renewal as a result of developing, discussing and showing their stories (p.5). 23 out of 24 participants even reported behavior changes towards improving their health after the creation of digital storytelling, which support the influence stories can have. (p.5)
            </li>
            <li>
              The participants also expressed interest in the storytelling process, regardless of computer skills, and the lack thereof seemed to not have impacted their ability to create stories anyway. (p.1)
            </li>
            <li>
              However, so far this study has only focused on the experience of the storyteller, and even noted that further study can be done on how the participants share their digital stories and how that might impact public perception of cancer. So the community impact aspect is inconclusive. (p.5)
