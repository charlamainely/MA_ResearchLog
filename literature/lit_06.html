          <h2 class="h2">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
                        <li>
              The paper presents an interesting example of creating an interactive experience to showcase the cultural legacy of ancient Mesopotamia. However, what I was mainly interested in was the reasoning for choosing a game as the tool for this task and the overall impact on the museum visitors.
            </li>
            <li>
              The author presents a compelling argument for why games, specifically serious game, creates a great environment for learners and how it can facilitate the learning process as well as create incentives for learner to continue. Additionally, there is also statistic to support why games would be the preferred choice for a younger audience who clearly has a fascination for this media.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, upon implementing this game, the project faced many challenges during production, which should be recognized. And it is also mentioned how it might be difficult to preserve this game specifically due to its reliance on hardware. This problem has been discussed during my research, and creates an argument for my choice of HTML5, which is less hardware reliance and more sustainable in the digital space.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite the challenges, the initiative seems to be well-received by the museum goers, and is even asked to be implemented in school by local educators, which highlights the potential for serious games to be well-received by a younger audience and possible implementation is different locations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h2">Reflections / Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p class="measure">
            The arguments from this study aligns well with my current understanding of serious games, as well as my findings from my residency, and overall support my choice to create a game for cultural preservation and engagement. 
However, the study also outlines challenges of game production as well as preservation that I will note for the prototyping process.
